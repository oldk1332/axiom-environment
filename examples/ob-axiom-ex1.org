This HTML was generated by org-mode from the file ob-axiom-ex1.org.

Contains embedded LaTeX and calls to the Axiom process via the

Define a couple of polynomials over the rationals, $p=x^2+1$ and
$q=x^3+1$, by

#+BEGIN_SRC axiom :exports results
p : UP(x, Fraction Integer) := x^2 + 1
q : UP(x, Fraction Integer) := x^3 + 1
#+END_SRC

then multiply them together

#+BEGIN_SRC axiom :exports results
r := p*q
#+END_SRC

and evaluate at a value supplied by Emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC axiom :exports results :var a=-3
eval(r, x=a)
#+END_SRC
